# b2-httpd

Hello. This is just the start of my exploration into Kotlin. I'd like to see what it is like using this language as a
webserver. The utility of this server is currently not defined and the resources it will serve are yet to be determined. For now, I'd like to consider this an experiment or even just a learning experience at best.

All contructive criticism is welcomed :)
